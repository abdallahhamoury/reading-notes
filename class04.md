## Links

##### Writing Links
>Links are created using the \<a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening \<a> tag and the closing \</a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

### Linking to Other Sites

\<a>
`Links are created using the \<a>
element which has an attribute
called href. The value of the
href attribute is the page that
you want people to go to when
they click on the link.`

### Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site

\<a>
`When you are linking to other
pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the
domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a
relative URL.`

### Directory Structure

On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the
pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a
website are sometimes referred to as directories.

### Opening Links in a New Window

#### target
If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening
\<a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.

## Layout

The simplest and most popular way of creating layouts is using HTML \<table> tag. These tables are arranged in columns and rows, so you can utilize these rows and columns in whatever way you like.

### Normal Flow
###### position:static
`In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default
way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not
need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow`

### Relative Positioning
###### position:relative

`Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow. For example, you can move it 10 pixels lower than it would have
been in normal flow or 20% to the right.`

### screen sizes

Check the browser window from 360×640 to 1920x1080 screen resolutions. Your page should score high on all criteria throughout the entire resolution range.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects
WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set
 of statements)


### Declare Function

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ()
Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables)

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: \{}

EX:
 >`function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}`


### Pair Programming

**pair programming** commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.

The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.[MORE](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)
