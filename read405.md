# big o in java
Big O describes the set of all algorithms that run no worse than a certain speed (it's an upper bound) Conversely, Big Ω describes the set of all algorithms that run no better than a certain speed (it's a lower bound) Finally, Big Θ describes the set of all algorithms that run at a certain speed (it's like equality)

Input Size

##### The length() method in Java is used for String objects which returns the number of characters in the string and the space the code will use

### Units of Measurement
- milliseconds
- operations
- Basic Operations


### Orders of Growth
An order of growth is a set of functions whose asymptotic growth behavior is considered equivalent. For example, 2n, 100n and n+1 belong to the same order of growth, which is written O(n) in Big-Oh notation and often called linear because every function in the set grows linearly with n

## What is a Linked List java

`The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList . The LinkedList class has all of the same methods as the ArrayList class because they both implement the List interface.`

Memory management
In Java, memory management is the process of allocation and de-allocation of objects, called Memory management. Java does memory management automatically. Java uses an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector. Thus, we are not required to implement memory management logic in our application.
