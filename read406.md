### Inheritance and Interfaces

## Object-Oriented
Object

the object is a software package for associated behavior and state.
Objects are for understanding object-oriented -programing technology.

They all have behavior and status
An object stores its state in fields (variables ) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions ).

- Code re-use: If an object already exists you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code.
- Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement
- Steganography: By interacting only with the object's methods, its internal implementation remain hidden from the world outside its own blueprint



### What Is Inheritance?

In the Java language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, but every superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses.
### What Is an Interface?
An interface is a device or a system that unrelated entities use to interact.
Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes
