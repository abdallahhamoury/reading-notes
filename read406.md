### Inheritance and Interfaces

An object stores its state in fields and exposes its behavior through methods.
A class is a blueprint from which objects are created

## Inheritance
Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features of another class.
Inheritance is a class  that is derived from another class . Every class in java is emplicitly inherited from Object class.

We use the keyword extends follow by the name of superclass we want to inherit from.

Methods are the interface of class with the outside world.
An interface is like a contract used to group related methods with empty bodies.
We can define new interface just like creating classes but with using interface keyword.
methods inside interface doesn't have curly braces, and are ended up with a semicolon.
To access the interface methods, the interface must be implemented  by another class with the implements keyword 
Unlike classes, an interface can extend any number of interfaces.
