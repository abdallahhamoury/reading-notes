# Hibernate Many to Many
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- both the Employee class and Project classes refer to one another, which means that the association between them is bidirectional.

- In order to map a many-to-many association, we use the @ManyToMany, @JoinTable and @JoinColumn annotations.

- The @ManyToMany annotation is used in both classes to create the many-to-many relationship between the entities.

- This association has two sides i.e. the owning side and the inverse side.

- The @JoinColumn annotation is used to specify the join/linking column with the main table.

# Web App Security
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web application security is a central component of any web-based business. The global nature of the Internet exposes web properties to attack from different locations and various levels of scale and complexity. Web application security deals specifically with the security surrounding websites, web applications and web services such as APIs.

New attack vectors are constantly emerging as technology evolves. Now more than ever, comprehensive security tools are needed. Previously, device endpoint protection and network security were the ultimate in protective measures.
