### Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

> Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.
> An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.



`Define a constructor and initialize properties`
To define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function. Below is a table that summarizes a JavaScript representation of an EpicFailVideo object.

Property | Data | Type
------------ | ------------- |--------------
epicRating | 1 to 10 | Number
hasAnimals | true or false	 | Boolean

### Tables in HTML :point_down:	

There are several types of information that need to be displayed in a grid or table. For example: sports results, stock reports, train timetables

##### Basic Table Structure

\<table>                                 
`The <table> element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row`

\<tr>
`You indicate the start of each
row using the opening <tr> tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
<td> elements (one for each cell
in that row).At the end of the row you use a
closing </tr> tag`


\<td>
`Each cell of a table is
represented using a <td>
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a
closing </td> tag.`

### Functions, Methods, and Objects
> JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.

##### Defining functions

`CREATING OBJECTS USING CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX`

There are several ways to define functions

**name**
The function name.

**param**
The name of an argument to be passed to the function.

**statements**
The statements comprising the body of the function
