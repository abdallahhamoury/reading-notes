# Text

● Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs

● Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on

### Headings

> HTML has six "levels" of headings:
> <h1> h1 is used for main headings
> <h2> h2 is used for subheadings
> If there are further sections under the subheadings then the
>  
> h3 element is used, and so on

  
  
### Paragraphs
  
  **To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening p tag and closing /p tag.**
  
  By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.
  
  
  ### Bold & Italic
  <b>
   By enclosing words in the tags b and /b we can make characters appear bold.
  <i>
   By enclosing words in the tags i and /i we can make characters appear italic.
    
  
### White Space  
    
In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often
add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines

 When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each
other, it only displays one space.
    
Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single
space too. This is known as white space collapsing.

  ## Introducing CSS
    
   > Understanding CSS: Thinking Inside the Box
    
    The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
    
    
### BLOCK & INLINE ELEMENTS

#### 1 - Internal CSS
    
Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add style tag in the head section of your HTML document. 
    
#### 2 - External CSS

With external CSS, you'll link your web pages to an external .css file, which can be created by any text editor in your device
    
#### 3 - Inline CSS
 
Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style, you’ll only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors.

Conditional Statements
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

>In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
    
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
    
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
    
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
    
    
 ## COMMENTS IN JS
    
You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code
