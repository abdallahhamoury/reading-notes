### Layout

`Building Blocks`
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

#### Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.


`It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div>
(or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together
all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and
the main navigation). The <div> element that contains this group of
elements is then referred to as the containing element.`

 
  #### Structure
  
  ##### How Pages Use Structure
  In order to understand a document, everyone depends on understanding its structure.
  For example, It includes a banner, multiple navigation menus, and the main content which you are reading currently.
  The main content is organized into sections marked by headings and subheadings,
  and the content within those sections is comprised mostly of paragraphs and lists.

 ### HTML elements and tags work together to mark up content.
  
  
 HTML elements indicate the purpose of a tag and tags indicate the beginning and the end of an element.

 For example, here is a simple paragraph in HTML:

 `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`

  ### What is difference between `#id` and `.class` in HTML? :eyes:
  
_The difference between an ID and a class is that the first one is unique, and the second one is not. This means that each element can have only one ID, and each page can have only one element with that ID. When using the same ID on multiple elements, the code won’t pass validation. But as the classes are not unique, the same class can be used on multiple elements, and vice versa, we can use several classes on the same element._

### Process & Design

#### WHO IS THE SITE FOR?

![Design](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/html-css/9781118206911/images/ch018-Uf001.jpg)

Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
It can be helpful to ask some questions about the people you would expect to be interested in the subject of your site.
Realistically, it is unlikely to be relevant to everyone.

### The ABC of Programming JS :beginner:

Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections:

> A

What is a script and how do I create one?

> B

How do computers fit in with the world around them?

> C

How do I write a script for a web page?

`Once you have learned the basics, the following chapters will show how the JavaScript language can be used to tell browsers what you want them to do.`

> A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS
> A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following:
> By following the instructions in a recipe, one-by-one in the order set out











## LISTS
*There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:*

● **Ordered lists:**
>are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

● **Unordered lists:**
 >are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

● **Definition lists:**
 >are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

### Definition Lists

#### \<dl>
The definition list is created with the \<dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
Inside the \<dl> element you will usually see pairs of \<dt> and \<dd> elements.

#### \<dt>
 This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).

 #### \<dd> 
 This is used to contain the definition.

 ### Nested Lists
 You can put a second list inside
an \<li> element to create a sublist or nested list.
