# GraphQL @connection
## Add relationships between types
The `@connection` directive enables you to specify relationships between `@model` types.
- one-to-one.
- one-to-many.
- and many-to-one.
> **implement many-to-many relationships using two one-to-many connections and a joining `@model` type.**
### Definition
`directive @connection(keyName: String, fields: [String!]) on FIELD_DEFINITION`
- @connection specified Relationships between types are annotating fields.
- The keyName argument can optionally be used to specify the name of secondary index that should be queried from the other type in the relationship.
- When specifying a keyName, the fields argument should be provided to indicate which field(s) will be used to get connected objects. If keyName is not provided, then @connection queries the target table's primary index.
```java
// Has one example
type Project @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  teamID: ID!
  team: Team @connection(fields: ["teamID"])
}
type Team @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```
