## JAVA
 
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable.

What is Java used for?
One of the most widely used programming languages, Java is used as the server-side language for most back-end development projects, including those involving big data and Android development. Java is also commonly used for desktop computing, other mobile computing, games, and numerical computing.

## Variables
We can say that there are two main types of fields or variables used within a ava code:

Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields): Instance variables (non-static variables) within a class are created at run-time, meaning that we declare them inside the class and if their values changed it will be reflected inside the same class only and will affect other classes.

static field: are fields that are shared and used by all the objects and loaded when class is loaded. you declare one at the main class and use it with every copy.


## Compiling
Compiling simply means is to stick to the language's rules (syntax) so your machine can correctly read the instruction you wrote without any errors.

### Statements 
Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution. The following types of expressions can be made into a statement by terminating the expression with a semicolon (;) (Links to an external site.)
### Blocks
a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.
