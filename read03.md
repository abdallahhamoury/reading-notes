# HTML basics

HTML `(Hypertext Markup Language)` is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs,a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables

**So what is HTML?**

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:

> My cat is very grumpy

__If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:__

> <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>


### Here, we have the following:

* `<!DOCTYPE html>` — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.

* `<html></html>` — the <html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.

* `<head></head>` — the <head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.

### Images 

***Let's turn our attention to the <img> element again:***

> <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">

### Marking up text

#### Headings

`<h1>My main title</h1>`
`<h2>My top level heading</h2>`
`<h3>My subheading</h3>`
`<h4>My sub-subheading</h4>`

#### Paragraphs

`<p>This is a single paragraph</p>`

#### Lists

1. **Unordered** lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <ul> element.

2. **Ordered** lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an <ol> element.

## The Definitive Guide: How To Create Your First Wireframe

![way](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1f8244b169ab5703e8f9cc7bb05cf3c1a2485b9b/87b59/en/blog/uploads/what-is-a-wireframe.jpg)

1. ***What is a wireframe, and why do UX designers use them?***
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

2. ***Examples of wireframes***
Before you start designing the wireframes of your own app or product, take a look at some examples of wireframes. This will give you some inspiration for your own wireframes, as well as giving you an idea of the variety of ways of creating them. Some people like to draw their wireframes by hand, others feel more comfortable using software like Invision, `or Balsamiq to create theirs`. We’ll go through some of the tools you can use to create wireframes shortly, but it’s important to emphasize that how you make yours is up to you: some people feel more creative when sat at their computer, while others prefer to have a pen and paper in hand.

3. ***What to consider when deciding on your wireframing process***

As we mentioned above, __different UX designers approach the task of wireframing in different ways.__ Some like to draw by hand, while others like to use apps or tools found online. But more often than not, the decision to use online tools or to wireframe by hand, and the process used to get to from wireframe to code, is less related to the individual preference of the UX Designer, and much more related to what approach the particular situation requires. It depends largely on how much emphasis there is on visual design in a project, and how much uncertainty there is with respect to what is being designed.

* Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
* Sketch > Code
* Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
* Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

4. ***The best tools for wireframing***

There are heaps of free tools out there for creating wireframes and prototypes, so you should experiment with as many as you can to find the ones that suit you the best. Don’t forget that you can also just use pen and paper! Below we’ve listed three online tools we find particularly good. The examples below all have free trials, so check them out!
