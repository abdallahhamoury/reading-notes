Packages and Import


### The first statement, other than comments, in a Java source file, must be the package declaration.
> Following the optional package declaration, you can have import statements, which allow you to specify classes from other packages that can be referenced without qualifying them with their package.
It is like a group which it used to group related classes and we use the Packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code.
The first statement must be the package declaration.

Loop Statements
Java provides different types of loops to fit any programming need. Each loop has its own purpose and a suitable use case to serve.


## For Loop
A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

## While Loop
The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.
