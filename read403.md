Each object contains one value of the corresponding base type. Cover categories are not subject to change

Java is an example of a statically typed language.

Java's type system involves not only classes and primitive types, but also other kinds of reference type that are related to the basic concept of a class, but which differ in some way


interface Centered {

  void setCenter(double x, double y);
  
  double getCenterX();
  
  double getCenterY();
}
