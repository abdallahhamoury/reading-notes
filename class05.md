## Images
`There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram or chart.`

#### Choosing Images for Your Site

#### Adding Images

\<img>
> chapter-05/adding-images.html HTML
To add an image into the page
you need to use an \<img>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:

- src
- alt
- title

EX: `<img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">`

### Height & Width of Images
 
 `height`

This specifies the height of the image in pixels

`width`

This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

EX: `<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket"style="width:500px;height:600px;">`

### Understanding Color

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

### Text

> The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:

● Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,
and the size of the text)

● Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters)


### Typeface Terminology

- Serif
- Sans-Serif
- Monospace

### Size of Type
##### font-size
EX:
`body {
font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;
font-size: 12px;}
h1 {
font-size: 200%;}
h2 {
font-size: 1.3em;}`

#### More Font Choice

@font-face allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded if it is not on the user's machine


### Letter & Word Spacing

letter-spacing, word-spacing 

Kerning is the term typographers use for the space between each letter. You can control the space between each letter with the letter-spacing property
