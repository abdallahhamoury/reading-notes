## HTML
###### Design and Build Websites

>What is the **HTML**?

The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page.
Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

### `we have to know there different ways in which people access the web`
  
  - **Browsers:**  People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular **examples** include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.
  - **Web Servers:** When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.
  - **Devices:** People are accessing websites on an increasing range of devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile
phones.
  - **Screen readers:** Screen readers are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.

  #### Structure
  
  ##### How Pages Use Structure
  In order to understand a document, everyone depends on understanding its structure.
  For example, It includes a banner, multiple navigation menus, and the main content which you are reading currently.
  The main content is organized into sections marked by headings and subheadings,
  and the content within those sections is comprised mostly of paragraphs and lists.

 ### HTML elements and tags work together to mark up content.
  
  
 HTML elements indicate the purpose of a tag and tags indicate the beginning and the end of an element.

 For example, here is a simple paragraph in HTML:

 `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`

  ### What is difference between `#id` and `.class` in HTML? :eyes:
  
_The difference between an ID and a class is that the first one is unique, and the second one is not. This means that each element can have only one ID, and each page can have only one element with that ID. When using the same ID on multiple elements, the code wonâ€™t pass validation. But as the classes are not unique, the same class can be used on multiple elements, and vice versa, we can use several classes on the same element._

#### There are elements used for coordination and arrangement, as mentioned below attached link:
