# Read 08 - OO design
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The concept of non-repetition of codes, which aims to develop programs, reduce repetitions, replace them with summaries, and use data normalization to avoid repetition.

Each piece must have within the system and is widely applied in its pragmatic writing and includes databases and build system. Modifying an element does not require and therefore is kept in sync and depends on code generators and automatic building systems

>There is also a principle that the programmer should not add functions unless they are needed

### Rule of three

##### It is a basic rule of code refactoring for deciding when similar pieces of code should be refactored to avoid duplication. When the rule changes encoded in a repeating part of the code however, choosing an appropriate design to avoid duplication may benefit from more examples to see patterns in. Trying to rebuild too early risks choosing the wrong abstraction, which could lead to worse code as new requirements emerge

The rule states that the cost of maintenance definitely outweighs the cost of rebuilding and possible poor design when there are three copies, and may or may not be if there are only two copies.

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a version of a product that has enough features for use by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development

They iterate on work versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about product requirements.

Because it tests a potential business model for customers to see how the market will react, it is particularly useful for new, emerging companies that are more interested in knowing where potential business opportunities are than implementing a pre-existing business model.
