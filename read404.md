In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. ... Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables

>The Java programming language allows you to define a class within another class. A nested class is a member of its enclosing class. ... Non-static >nested classes (inner classes) have access to other members of the enclosing class, even if they are declared private

We are all familiar with the base 10 number system that we use in our every day
lives. The base 10 number system is just one example of a positional number system. In a
positional number system a number is represented as a series of digits, where each digit
position is associated with a weight. For example, the number representing the year 2003
can be represented as follows:
2003 = 2 * 103
 + 0 * 102
 + 0 * 101
 + 3 * 100
position 3 2 1 0
